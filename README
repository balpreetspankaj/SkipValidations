SkipValidations
===============

This plugin disables validations in your specs, so that you can skip validations for certain models in your test. You can choose models for which you want to turn your validations off.

Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	validates_presence_of :email
	validates_presence_of :password
end

class SellRequest < ActiveRecord::Base
	belongs_to :user
	def self.match_requests(sell_request)
		if matching_request?
			sell_request.user.money -= tax
			sell_request.user.save!
		end
	end
end 

Consider the above cooked up example. There might be situation where while testing you might want to skip the validations of user model altogether, which you are testing the functionality of match_requests. This is where the plugin will come in handy. Inside your rspec examples just do:

it "should decrease user money" do
  User.skip_validations(:user) {SellRequest.match_requests}
  @sell_request.user.money.should == xx
end

You can specify multiple models as in:
User.skip_validations(:user, :person)

You can pass models as symbols or strings.
